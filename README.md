Cake Dog
---
A loyal friend help for watching your CoffeeScript files

[![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sailxjx/cake-dog.png)](https://travis-ci.org/sailxjx/cake-dog)

## Install
```
[sudo] npm install -g cake-dog
```

## Usage

### Cli mode
You can use `cakedog` as a command-line tool
```
$ cakedog --help

  Usage: cakedog [options] <command>

  Commands:

    compile                compile to JavaScript and save as .js files
    watch                  watch for the file changes and compile to .js files
    unwatch                stop watch for the file changes
    resurrect              resurrect previously watched processes

  Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    -V, --version          output the version number
    -o, --output <output>  set the output directory for compiled JavaScript
    -s, --source <source>  set the source directory for CoffeeScript
```

### In Cakefile
You can prepend one line in your [`Cakefile`](http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/cake.html)

```
require("cake-dog")(options)
```

Now use `cake` command to see new tasks, these cake tasks will compile the source code from 'source' to 'output'

The default options is {source: 'src', output: 'lib'}

```
$ cake
Cakefile defines the following tasks:

cake compile      # once compile coffee scripts to javascript files
cake watch        # real-time compile coffee scripts to javascript files
cake unwatch      # stop compile coffee scripts to javascript files
```

## Uninstall

```
[sudo] npm rm -g cake-dog
```

And don't forget to remove the `require("cake-dog")` in your Cakefile (if you have done this).

Done!

## ChangeLog
### v0.4.1
* support options in Cakefile

### v0.4.0
* install cakedog as a global package and run in cli mode
* auto save the latest watch directories, and resurrect after reboot
* add options to watch directories

## Known Issues
* `Error: watch EMFILE` when use `cake compile:watch`
  This is caused by the limit of the use of system-wide resources in *nix system, you can increase the limitation by `ulimit -n XXXX` and this message will not show again, the `XXXX` is the number of limitation, set it greater than your watched file number.
